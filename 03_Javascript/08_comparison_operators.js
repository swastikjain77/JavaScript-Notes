What is a Comparison Operator in JavaScript?


Understand Equality Operator in JavaScript [==]
let num1 = '77'
let num2 =77
Its convent the string and compare, output is true - it does implicit automatic conversion


Strict Equality in JavaScript [===]
let num1 = 24
let num2 = 24
When we use === operator it check the type and number - you have to do explicit manual conversion


Understand When Things Are Not Equal in JavaScript [!=]
If the condition is not equal then it return true for example
let num1 = 24
let num2 = '24'
output is false - this is work similar equal


Not Equal to Strict [!==]
let num1 = 24
let num2 = 24
output is false -now it is check type and number both


Is It Greater Than Or Less Than in JS?
let num1 = 20
let num2 = 24
num1 > [greater then] num2 = false
num1 < [less then] num2 = true
num1 >=[greater then & equal to] num2 = false
num1 <=[less then & equal to] num2 = true
