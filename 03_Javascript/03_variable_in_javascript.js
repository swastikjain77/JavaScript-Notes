/*

There are total 3 types of varibles

1) let
2) const
3) var

let: We can use let to storage data in it and also we resign the data/change the data that is stored in
the variable

let userName = "swastik"
let myAge = 25

const: We cannot change the data that is stored in the variable

const bigPlanet = Sun
const hourInDay = 24

var: There is not much difference between int and var,

for example:

{
    let a = 12  // We can access the (a variable  let and const) only in the nearest brackets
}


function(){
    if(true){
        var a = 12;
    }
        console.log(a);  // We can access the (a varible var) nearest function
}
