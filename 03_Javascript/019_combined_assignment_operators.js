Subtraction Assignment Operator (-=):
Subtracts the right operand from the left and assigns the result to the left operand.
let a = 10;
a -= 3; // a becomes 7 because 10 - 3 = 7


Remainder Assignment Operator (%=):
Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the remainder to the left operand.
let x = 15;
x %= 4; // x becomes 3 because 15 % 4 = 3


Multiplication Assignment Operator (*=):
Multiplies the left operand by the right and assigns the result to the left operand.
// let num = 5
// num = num * 2
// num = num * 2
// num = num * 2
// console.log(num)
// Shortcut
// let num = 5
// num *= 2
// num *= 2
// num *= 2
// console.log(num)


Addition Assignment Operator (+=):
Adds the right operand to the left and assigns the result to the left operand.
let num = 5
num += 5
num += 5
num += 5
num += 5
console.log(num)


Exponentiation Assignment Operator (**=)
let z = 3;
z **= 2; // z becomes 9 because 3 ** 2 = 9


Increment Operator (++):
Increases a variable's value by 1.
++num - This will add and return same time (on spot)
num++ - This will show the pervious value then add in the behind


Decrement Operator (--):
Decreases a variable's value by 1.
let x = 5
console.log(x)
 x--
console.log(x)
--x
console.log(x)
